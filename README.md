# Monthly Meetup Notes

[Visit our website](https://fullstacktc.org)

If you're presenting feel free to submit a pull request against the repo adding your notes, slides, examples and whatever other materials you wish to share with the community.

Try to follow the same example as previous months, meetups are broken up via dated folders, the notes go inside of the README in that folder, followed by any files you wish to throw in there.
